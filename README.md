# CS6216 Project
Reproduction of Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC)

We reproduce experiments in SGHMC, and also extend to Fashion-MNIST, momentum and Adam optimizer.

## 1. Toy sampling example implementation
   toy.py
## 2. Bayesian neural network experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST
   modified_main.py
   
   You can test different methods just by changing the setting of "param.updater"
